importHealthData()             // Upload previous data
```

### Customization Guide

#### 1. Change AI Model
```javascript
// In main.js, line 6
const GEMINI_CONFIG = {
    API_KEY: 'your-key',
    MODEL: 'gemini-2.5-flash',  // Change to: gemini-2.0-flash, gemini-pro-latest
    API_URL: 'https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/MODEL:generateContent'
};
```

#### 2. Add New Symptoms
```javascript
// In main.js, loadSymptomData() method
this.allSymptoms = [
    'existing_symptom1',
    'existing_symptom2',
    'your_new_symptom',  // ← Add here
    // ...
];

// Then add severity weight in symptomData
this.symptomData = {
    'your_new_symptom': { severity: 4, category: 'respiratory' },
    // ...
};
```

#### 3. Add New Disease
```javascript
// In main.js, disease database section
this.diseaseDatabase = [
    {
        name: 'Your New Disease',
        symptoms: ['symptom1', 'symptom2', 'symptom3'],
        confidence_threshold: 0.6,
        severity_multiplier: 1.2,
        medications: ['drug1', 'drug2'],
        diet: ['food1', 'food2'],
        exercise: ['exercise1'],
        precautions: ['warning1']
    },
    // ... existing diseases
];
```

#### 4. Customize UI Colors
```javascript
// In each HTML file, modify Tailwind classes
<div class="bg-blue-600">  <!-- Change to: bg-purple-600, bg-green-600, etc. -->
<div class="text-emerald-600">  <!-- Use any Tailwind color -->

// Or add custom CSS
<style>
:root {
    --primary-color: #your-color;
    --secondary-color: #your-color;
}
</style>
```

#### 5. Modify Animations
```javascript
// In HTML files, find anime() calls
anime({
    targets: '.element',
    translateY: [50, 0],     // Modify values
